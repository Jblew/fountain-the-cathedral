# Water Fountain "The Cathedral"

The story behind:

1. AD 1882 — [Antoni Gaudí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD) builds the [Sagrada Família church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia)

2. AD 2000 — The Sagrada Familia church inspires [Jacek Dukaj](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacek_Dukaj) to write a short story — ["The Cathedra"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katedra_(opowiadanie)).

3. AD 2002 — [Tomasz Bagiński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Bagi%C5%84ski) ilustrates the story with his wonderful (and at that time technically astonishing) [animation "The Cathedral"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_(film)).

4. AD 2019 — After seeing the Church, watching the Animation and reading the Story (in this order) I decided to build a tribute to the Three Great Artists: Gaudi, Dukaj and Bagiński

They have already used three art techniques: architecture, literature and digital animation. To continue the chain of inspiration I had to choose a different one.
