# Water Fountain "The Cathedral"

The story behind:

1. AD 1882 — [Antoni Gaudí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD) builds the [Sagrada Família church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia)

2. AD 2000 — The Sagrada Familia church inspires [Jacek Dukaj](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacek_Dukaj) to write a short story — ["The Cathedra"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katedra_(opowiadanie)).

3. AD 2002 — [Tomasz Bagiński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Bagi%C5%84ski) ilustrates the story with his wonderful (and at that time technically astonishing) [animation "The Cathedral"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_(film)).

4. AD 2019 — After seeing the Church, watching the Animation and reading the Story (in this order) I decided to build a tribute to the Three Great Artists: Gaudi, Dukaj and Bagiński

They have already used three art techniques: architecture, literature and digital animation. To continue the chain of inspiration I had to choose a different one.

## Update

### Stage 1

[See photos](./stage_1/photos.md)

**Done**:

1. Built cathedral backbone of copper wire
2. Secured the backbone with styro foam



### Stage 2

[See photos](./stage_2/photos.md)

**Done:**

1. Selected and prepared 2 granite stones
2. Drilled fi12mm holes for the supporting rods (3 holes in the smaller stone and 7 in the bigger one)
3. Drilled 19 fi8mm holes to attach the cathedral building

**Comment:**

I used diamond hole-saws together with constant water flow (using 450l/h pump). Despite using the maximum rotation speed of the driller it took more than 16 hours to drill all the holes. During the drilling I destroyed 4 saws.



### Stage 3

[See photos](./stage_3/photos.md)

**Done:**

1. I drilled the "magnum foramen" through the centre of the bigger stone. Because of the limited length of the hole-saws I had to mark the position stereotactically and then drill separate holes on each side. Then I used a hammer and steel rods to carefoully chisel the remaining stone from inside.
2. On the upper side I widened the foramen opening using diamond mills (spindle- and ball-shaped). Thanks to that I achived an "anxious" look of the dark and deep hole. What is more — thanks to the wide opening — woter that is flowing upwards through the tunnel doesn't "shoot" in a fountain-like manner. Instead it flows slowly.
3. I drilled many glens, gorgens and faults to guide the direction of water flow. After the procedures water is flowing only in the front direction spreading into an elegant and majestic delta.
4. I drilled supporting tunnels that connect with the main foramen and open on the front waterfall. The idea is to have limited amount of water flowing through the floor of the cathedral while maintaining high flow through the waterfall.
