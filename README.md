# Water Fountain "The Cathedral"

The story behind:

1. AD 1882 — [Antoni Gaudí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD) builds the [Sagrada Família church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia)

2. AD 2000 — The Sagrada Familia church inspires [Jacek Dukaj](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacek_Dukaj) to write a short story — ["The Cathedra"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katedra_(opowiadanie)).

3. AD 2002 — [Tomasz Bagiński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Bagi%C5%84ski) ilustrates the story with his wonderful (and at that time technically astonishing) [animation "The Cathedral"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_(film)).

4. AD 2019 — After seeing the Church, watching the Animation and reading the Story (in this order) I decided to build a tribute to the Three Great Artists: Gaudi, Dukaj and Bagiński

They have already used three art techniques: architecture, literature and digital animation. To continue the chain of inspiration I had to choose a different one.

## Update

### Stage 1

[See photos](./stage_1/photos.md)

**Done**:

1. Built cathedral backbone of copper wire
2. Secured the backbone with styro foam



### Stage 2

[See photos](./stage_2/photos.md)

**Done:**

1. Selected and prepared 2 granite stones
2. Drilled fi12mm holes for the supporting rods (3 holes in the smaller stone and 7 in the bigger one)
3. Drilled 19 fi8mm holes to attach the cathedral building

**Comment:**

I used diamond hole-saws together with constant water flow (using 450l/h pump). Despite using the maximum rotation speed of the driller it took more than 16 hours to drill all the holes. During the drilling I destroyed 4 saws.



### Stage 3

[See photos](./stage_3/photos.md)

**Done:**

1. I drilled the "magnum foramen" through the centre of the bigger stone. Because of the limited length of the hole-saws I had to mark the position stereotactically and then drill separate holes on each side. Then I used a hammer and steel rods to carefoully chisel the remaining stone from inside.
2. On the upper side I widened the foramen opening using diamond mills (spindle- and ball-shaped). Thanks to that I achived an "anxious" look of the dark and deep hole. What is more — thanks to the wide opening — woter that is flowing upwards through the tunnel doesn't "shoot" in a fountain-like manner. Instead it flows slowly.
3. I drilled many glens, gorgens and faults to guide the direction of water flow. After the procedures water is flowing only in the front direction spreading into an elegant and majestic delta.
4. I drilled supporting tunnels that connect with the main foramen and open on the front waterfall. The idea is to have limited amount of water flowing through the floor of the cathedral while maintaining high flow through the waterfall.



### Stage 4

[See photos](./stage_4/photos.md)

**Done:**

1. First, I encountered a problem of creating a plane model of holes of the bottom side of both stones. When I was drilling them they often were misplaced compared to the original stencil. I had to position the stones correctly and then somehow create another plain stencil. Positioning was demanding since the stones are very heavy. i used wooden blocks and old clothes to precisely position them. To create a stencil I put a huge transparent acrylic glass onto the stones. Using a laser (which I ensured that was staying in a perfectly right angle to the glass) I ensured that the laser dot appears exactly in the middle of each hole. Then I marked the laser spots on the glass. Next step was to drill the holes through the acrylic and copy the appertures of the holes to a semi-transparent engineering paper.
2. Using the stencils I drilled the same set of holes in a wooden 600x600mm shelf which then I hanged above the stones. I inserted fi12mm rods both into the wells in the stones and the holes in the hanging piece of wood. I had to position it using steel wires attached to the ceiling and walls. I used level tool a lot to ensure that all the angles are correctly positioned.
3. I marked the position of the wooden plane on the rods, labelled them with numbers (put the same numbers on the stencil) — and then I cut each rod to end at the exact position of the plane. 
4. After I had each rod lengthened properly  I secured them to the plane with nuts and steel rings which also prevented the plane from oscillating on the steel wires.
5. Then the most time consuming process begun. I had to attach the rods to the stone in an extremly strong and reliable manner. The best idea that appealed to me was to use a "chemical anchor". After studying chemical and physical specs of several of such products I bought a Pattex chemical anchor that was waterproof and was designed exactly for connecting steel and stone. A chemical anchor consists of two ingredients that mix up in a special mixer attached at the end of aplying tool and then are applied directly into the holes.
6. Over the next 4 weekends I was unscrewing 3 rods each time and apply the chemical anchor. Then I needed to leave it for about 18 hours to get a strong bond. Almost half of them didn't mount securely at the first appliance and I had to clean the holes, drill-out the artificial sand and apply it one more time.
